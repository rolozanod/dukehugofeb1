# RL FORK
I followed the instructions in the [Chapter 02](https://paiml.com/docs/home/books/cloud-computing-for-data/chapter02-cloud-foundations/) and the [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xiodvLdPnvI).

I changed the theme to Detox.

There were some changes given new hugo and aws versions were released.
I was recieving a missing index.html error because the themes were not found so I echoed the build and added `git submodule update --init --recursive` to fix that error.
